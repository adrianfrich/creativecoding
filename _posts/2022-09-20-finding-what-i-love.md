what i've been into recently:
- cellular automata in javascript, learning about Conway's Game of Life in Interactive Media Class.


- finding out that my music taste will sort of stagnate at this stage of my life but i'm pretty cool with that because I'm into heaps of genres 

net_art design process & tutorial
