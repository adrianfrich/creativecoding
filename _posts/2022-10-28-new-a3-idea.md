<h1>Four Channel Looper using MAX</h1>

This was an awesome build! The whole time I was just dedicated to getting this to work with the finite amount of time I had, and I loved how it turned out, making it look complex with the strings and nodes, it's looks like art to me. 

Post presentation thoughts: I think I made enough sense to convey the short story I was trying to sell;

1. I'm interested in loopers/instruments and wanted to share that to other people
2. The point was that I wanted this tool to be accessible to non-musical friends
3. I plan to build on top of this tool in the future to see if I can extend its use to other friends. 

I feel like using MAX as a tool is sort of like the gateway drug to other visual code tools. My personal learning style has always been learn by doing, while p5 and other similar languages were experimental, I found it difficult to keep engaged enough to go even further with the complexities of the code. Going ahead, I plan to start using programs like TouchDesigner and see how I can further progress with MAX.

<h2>Course Reflections</h2>

<b>What have you learnt?</b>
<br>
Besides all the technical skills you pick up in this unit, I think that having the ability to experiment, learn on your terms, consistent blogging and forming a mycelial connection with the people within the creative coding space have all in conjunction, taught me the importance of collaboration. Not just in terms of oh, here's a group of people that you have to work with for assignment, (which we didn't have any of but the point is) but to use our technical skills to serve a greater purpose that is not just for ourselves and for our own benefit. To serve a community, or to bring people together or strengthen relationships, or to even share the same space with people that share the same interests and goals is enough to feel like you have a place somewhere in this world.
