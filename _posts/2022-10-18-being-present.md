<h1>20 something</h1>
The CoP idea sort of goes hand in hand with this idea and practice of being more present, for not just myself, but for the mycelial relationships I have in my life so far. To acknowledge the fact that I do, and with any complex human being, have some sort of inner turmoil that needs to be highlighted and evaluated whether or not it affects the person to becoming their authentic self or just simply to live presently with no weight in the past or anxieties in the future. 

I think that as we transition into an era with so much information, so many messages from media, so much influence from external forces can play a role in my own wellbeing, and having my emotional development and growth so closely tied to media, it can be extremely hard to stray away from it sometimes. How do we remedy this? What's one thing that can reclaim you back from phone dependency? Socialising - strengthening friendships, relationships, being present for each, getting to know people on a deeper level. 

The question goes: How do I turn up for myself, so that I can turn up for other people? Things as a mid 20 something would have to ask themselves every single damn day

- How can I be more emotionally present?
- What thoughts serve me? What thoughts don't?
- What are my boundaries?
- Are my needs being met? If not, how do I provide these to myself? 

Things I know that works so far: 

- Getting ample sleep
- Saying no to people and things when necessary
- Getting vitamin D from the lovely sun
- Getting enough exercise
- Socialising with friends
- Eating nutritious food
- Drinking enough water
- Journaling (showing gratitude)
- Being present in nature






<b>Note from future me:</b> As this original idea isn't quite what my end product reflects, I think that the thoughts here are still 100% valid. They reflect the confusing times of being a mid 20 something year old.
