<b> assignment reflection </b>

I pivoted ideas many times throughout the whole process of this assigment. Originally, fractal trees felt like something I could put my efforts into but as I progressed along, I wanted to shift my focus on 3D elements, 3D fractal trees proved to be something that I felt out of my scope of skills. I eventually stumbled upon a tutorial that explained how procedual elements worked, and by utlising procedral functions with noise maps/Simplex noise in conjunction with three.js, you are able to create a simulated environment that resembles a landscape. In this metaphor I draw upon simulating a virtual environment contained within a snow globe.

<b> - Perlin Noise </b>

Perlin becomes useful in graphical design and game design where the psuedo-random appearance mimics environments that resemble nature landscapes such as mountain ranges or islands.

<b> - Simplex Noise </b>

Similar to the Perlin noise map, Simplex noise has lower computational complexity and fewer multiplications - this gives our environment a smoother map to draw upon, giving it a somewhat believable illusion that there's mountain peaks or hills.
