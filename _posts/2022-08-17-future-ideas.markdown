<h1> implementing creative coding.</h1>
<p> <b> What does creative coding mean to me as of right now? (as a digital design student) </b> </p>

<p> I stumbled upon three.js not too long ago, it's a library I am very interested in, and I want to be able to use Javascript in order to bolster my skillset using the library. I have a background in Architecture and while I was in that field my interests and goals were getting the best most realistic renders. On top of that, interactivity was important to me at the time, the idea of someone walking through their house in their browser is something I set my eyes on. Since then, I had been experimenting with 3D models, augmented reality and 3D walkthroughs. I've chosen to specialise in 3D modelling and environment design in Digital Media. Fast forward to today, I can see so much potential in using javascript and it's multitude of libraries, from creating interactive games through to making my folio a tad bit fancier.

<h1> three.js research</h1>

<p> The basics of three.js sound very familiar (some of the p5 elements sound like they can be translated here, especially with the perspective camera, scene and using WEBGL.) Once you have set up the three basic components, the scene, the camera and the renderer, you are ready to go! Below I've included the basic setup of how it looks.
