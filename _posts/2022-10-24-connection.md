<h1>Connection</h1>

- domain = a room, a living room
- repertoire = facing towards each other
- shared values = connection, empathy

Using computer code to bring people closer together, reconnecting with friends. It takes effort to maintain friendships, along the way you might simply lose the connection between someone that you haven’t seen in a long time because your life trajectories change. One moment you’re spending time with them playing a game, or talking to them online, eating lunch together. Until you’re faced with the realisation that you haven’t seen each other in months and those months turn into years. 

WNRS does a really good job of connecting people together - once you’re in a physical setting, or in an intimate setting. This requires steps to get to. past-present-future aims to fill in that gap, a short-way of reconnecting with someone you once lost or feel losing a connection to, or even a way of strengthening current connections. 



Drawing three unique types of cards that aim to focus on strengthening the friendship/relationship of one another.

The first card will focus on an aspect of the past within a friendship.
This can include a question that aims for gratefulness

    Q. What’s something that I wouldn’t change about you?

    Is there a trait about this person you admire?

    What's something you'll remember about me?




The second card will focus on embracing the present through empathy. Bringing the person on what’s happening in the now. 
This will include a piece of information that the recipient may not know. It will aim to clear any misunderstanding or something that’s been on your mind that you want to get out.

    Q. Has your first impression of me changed since we met?

 



The third card will focus on connecting, it aims to provide the user a chance to make future plans together. 
This card aims to bridge a person's relationship with another person to form a stronger connection by including them in someone’s future.

    Q. Describe the perfect day for us. 

<b>Future note from me:</b> I was getting really frustrated at this point with the fact that I couldn't get the email form working and it was driving me insane, it felt like I was going in circles to the point where I had decided to change ideas, without the email function I wasn't able to fully develop my idea, without it, it would've felt bare bones and simple. 

So obviously, my idea has changed over time, I pivoted this idea as I was checking out all of the software options and I found this really intuitive looking software that called MAX8. At this point I didn't have much time to mess around with the software myself, I had to hit the ground running, so I decided to build upon a Tutorial. 

My core ideas from here still hold it's original intention, to connect with another person, in this case it isn't with my close friends, it was my my younger brother.
