<h1> implementing creative coding.</h1>
<p> <b> What does creative coding mean to me as of right now? (as a digital design student) </b> </p>

<p> I stumbled upon three.js not too long ago, it's a library I am very interested in, and I want to be able to use Javascript in order to bolster my skillset using the library. I have a background in Architecture and while I was in that field my interests and goals were getting the best most realistic renders. On top of that, interactivity was important to me at the time, the idea of someone walking through their house in their browser is something I set my eyes on. Since then, I had been experimenting with 3D models, augmented reality and 3D walkthroughs. I've chosen to specialise in 3D modelling and environment design in Digital Media
