<h1> Graphic Design in the Post-Digital Age </h1>

This was the book I came across while browsing through a book store on Swanston St a few months ago, I had heard about creative coding through a friend. I'd shown my curiosity asking them if there was a class in the course that was running content on it. Naturally I was intrigued, being creative and implementing sophisticated coding at the same time? That sounds fresh, exciting and innovative, maybe I skill that is sought after in the industry? A part of me signing up for coding in the first place was because I had felt it was necessary to pick up such skill in the industry. Should I, as a designer, have experience in coding to feel "ahead of the curve"? I was moreso interested in the fact that coding had a place in graphic design. I really didn't know what I was signing up for, but I took the leap of faith.

Here we are a few weeks later, we're in week 4 of this unit now, I've only just properly getting the hang of setting up this blog. We're getting somewhere at this point. Looking back at what I would do more effectively, is to apply the technical coding skills that we've learnt in class, outside of class. Below are some of the examples of what intrigues me to continue to pursue creative coding to fuel my ideas.
