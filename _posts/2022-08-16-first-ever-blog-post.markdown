<h1> Graphic Design in the Post-Digital Age </h1>

This was the book I came across while browsing through a book store on Swanston St a few months ago, I had heard about creative coding through a friend. I'd shown my curiosity asking them if there was a class in the course that was running content on it. Naturally I was intrigued, being creative and implementing sophisticated coding at the same time? That sounds fresh, exciting and innovative, maybe I skill that is sought after in the industry? A part of me signing up for coding in the first place was because I had felt it was necessary to pick up such skill in the industry. Should I, as a designer, have experience in coding to feel "ahead of the curve"? I was moreso interested in the fact that coding had a place in graphic design. I really didn't know what I was signing up for, but I took the leap of faith.

I think what really drew me into creative coding in the first place was the level of complexity that javascript allowed - one of the more impressive folios I've encountered was one of Bruno Simon's (<a href="url">https://bruno-simon.com/</a>). His website uses three.js. I haven't researched much about it at this stage but I know it's something that intrigues me and will be beneficial to my folio in the near future.

A lot of my ideas and inspirations come from a 3D design perspective, if there's an opportunity for me to make anything 3D related then I am all for it. Naturally I gravitated towards elements that have revolving 3D elements such as the various geometries you can render in Javascript. As you see in the frame below, this is the initial sketch for my idea and I'm using this as a base for the final idea in my head. I also have a big interest in music, I love going to local gigs, I enjoy playing various instruments such as the guitar, piano and bass. My music tastes vary, but I am particularly drawn to electronica and I think the synth sounds you can play around with in Javascript seem like a field I can dip my feet into.

My eyes were glued to this for 10 minutes straight, I love 3D geometries.
